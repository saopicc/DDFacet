## NB: Changes introduced for issue #255:
##   
##
##  * ``DefaultParset.cfg`` now contains comment clauses which are auto-parsed into documentation by ``ReadCfg.py``, and 
##  automatically converted into OptionParser command-line arguments. 
##
##  * Command-line arguments are formed as ``--Section-OptionName``.
##
##  * Each section can contain a ``_Help = section description`` option. This is turned into a docstring for the section.
##
##  * Each option line can contain a comment, preceded by "#". This is turned into a docstring for the option. Note that
##  long comments can be continued on the next line simply by indenting the next line. 
##
##  * Option comments can have embedded attributes of the form ``#attr:value``. These are removed from the docstring 
##  automatically. All attributes are optional! A few attributes have special meaning, as per below. 
##
##  * ``#type:TYPE`` forces the option to be interpreted as a specific Python type. E.g. ``#type:bool``, ``#type:str``,
##  ``#type:float``. In the absence of an explicit type attribute, the option will be parsed into a valid Python value 
##  (using ``eval()``), and converted into a string if that fails. This means that e.g. "None" will be interpreted as 
##  ``None`` and not the string ``"None"``. Note that this mechanism has some pitfalls: for example "all" gets parsed 
##  into the built-in ``all()`` function (unless surrounded by quotes), so if you want to make sure an option is treated 
##  as a string, make sure you add a ``#type:str`` attribute. 
##
##  * ``#options:A|B|C`` specifies that the option is a "selector" with a fixed set of values. See, for example, 
##  ``#options:None|LOFAR|FITS`` in BeamModel. 
##
##  * ``#metavar:VAR`` is passed to the metavar argument of ``OptionParser.add_option()``. This makes for a nicer-looking
##   command-line help. E.g. ``#metavar:MHz``. 
##
##  * ``#cmdline-only:1`` specifies that the option can only be changed from the command-line, not via a parset. 
##
##  * Options can have aliases. *NB: I'm not convinced about this feature. Maybe it makes things too confusing and should
##   be removed.* For example, 
##
##  ```
##  [Caching]
##  PSF|CachePSF            = 1         # Cache PSF data. May be expensive with large images, hence optional #type:bool
##  ```
##
##  means that the command-line option can be specified as ``--Caching-PSF`` or ``--CachePSF``. The second form is the 
##  "global alias". The GD object in DDFacet will contain both ``GD["Caching"]["PSF"]`` and 
##  ``GD["Caching"]["CachePSF"]``, set to the same value.
